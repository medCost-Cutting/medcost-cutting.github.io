  <h1 class="center">Introduction to Global Options</h1>
  <p>God willing, all will be able to find solutions with this listing: Locals across the globe, travellers (for business and/or for pleasure) that suddenly require medical-services, and/or medical-tourists traveling ESPECIALLY for lower-priced and/or higher-quality healthcare, etc. Let's see!</p>
  <p>But for those travelling abroad, somethings should be kept in mind: <strong>Travel advice & advisories</strong>! (ALSO, <strong>save your embassy's emergency-assistance to nationals 24/7-hotline on your phone</strong>!) While some government's write-ups make general rules, <strong>2 actually make heat-maps that show you were the safe(r) & (more) dangerous parts of your destination are</strong>: →<a href="https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations"><abbr title="Commonwealth of Australia" tabindex="01">Australia</abbr> 🇦🇺</a>'s & →<a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" tabindex="02">the <abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland">U.K.</abbr> 🇬🇧</a>'s. Of course, <strong>some will mention tips & warnings others will miss, so reading more from more sources, and deciding for yourself what's most applicable in your situation is probably more advisable</strong>.
