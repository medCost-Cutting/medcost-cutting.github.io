      <summary><strong>Introduction</strong></summary>
      <p>Want to <strong>pay the discounted prices the insurance-companies pay</strong>, instead of paying the full price? You can <strong>buy into that</strong>! As said in the <time datetime="2014">2014</time>-published book (in p.53-54), with <strong>my emphasis added</strong>:
      <blockquote>
        <p>Most sellers of medical discount cards are independent businesses that buy their access to discounted prices through insurance companies, although some insurance companies including Assurant and Blue Cross / Blue Shield also sell medical discount cards.</p>
        <p>Most medical discount plans include a <strong>wide range of health providers</strong>, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, pharmacy benefits, dental, and vision care. Some plans are limited to pharmacy, dental, vision, and chiropractic providers.</p>
        <p>The <strong>savings can be substantial for the uninsured</strong> (<strong>people with high-deductable plans already have access to the discounted prices</strong> and <strong>don't need medical discount cards</strong>), <strong>often ranging between 20 and 40 percent</strong> depending on the provoder and services. While prices and plans vary from company to company, medical discount cards typically involve payment of $25 or more.</p>
        <p>People considering using a medical discount plan should be aware that <strong>the industry has a problem with poor quality and fraud</strong> from some companies. Typical problems include providers not accepting plans, out-of-date information, deceptive marketing practices that confuse peopleinto thinking they are buying insurnace, and fly-by-night scams in which people buy worthless plans.</p>

      <p>To combat the issues in the latter paragraph, California's <a href="https://healthconsumer.org" tabindex="01">Health Consumer Alliance</a> ("Funded by generous support from The California Endowment, the <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/" tabindex="02">California Department of Managed Health Care</a>, Covered California, and the Blue Shield Foundation.") setup a trade-association to establish industry best--practices, and collaborate with regulators & State attorneys-general in safeguardng the industry. They also devised, with <strong>my emphases added</strong>, the…

          <blockquote><strong>9 Tips for Shopping for a Discount Healthcare Program</strong>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Shop around.</strong> Every program is different. Find the program that offers the benefits and services that best suit your needs at a reasonable price.</li>
              <li>Make sure the discount program has <strong>clear and understandable disclosure materials</strong> that <strong>specifically define the terms and conditions of the program</strong>.</li>
              <li>Look for programs that provide <strong>toll free numbers</strong> and/or <strong>websites</strong> where you can <strong>obtain additional information</strong> about the program's' benefits and the healthcare providers who are participating in them.</li>
              <li>Read the program's <strong>complaint and refund policies</strong> carefully to determine if they are reasonable. The company should offer a <strong>30-day refund policy</strong> for your membership fee.</li>
              <li>Make sure the program's materials clearly state that the discount program is <strong>not insurance</strong>.</li>
              <li>Be sure the program's benefits do <strong>not duplicate your current healthcare insurance policy</strong> or other health benefits offered by your employer.</li>
              <li><strong>Be wary of any program that requires large up-front fees.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Read all materials carefully.</strong></li>
              <li>When in doubt about a discount healthcare program, <strong>check the company out</strong> with your local Better Business Bureau, State Insurance Department, or State Attorney General's office.</li>
