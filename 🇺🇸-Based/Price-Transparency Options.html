The sites below can be a good starting point for finding out what typical prices are for many health care treatments.</blockquote>

                  <p>One of the features at <abbr>BCBB</abbr> is  printed agreement specifying what the fair price is that patients can take to their provider and aks them to give them that price.</p>
                  <p>One drawback of the <abbr>BCBB</abbr> is that it generates its fair prices largely based on what health insureres pay providers. This means that the prices given can actually be higher than those offered by cash-only or cash-friendly primary care practices, but in areas where cash-friendly options are limited, <abbr title="Healthcare Bluebook">HBB</abbr> can be a great starting point for negotiating with providers for a better price (and the site does include a guide to negotiating prices with doctors and hospitals, available at <del>https://www.healthcarebluebook.com/page_ContactDoctor.aspx</del>).</p>

                  <p>This provides two benefits: the patient knows ahead of time how much their care is going to cost, and the prices are typically much lower than list prices that the uninsured self-pay patients might otherwise pay. According to the site, employers who use this service for their employee plans generally save between 25 and 40 percent, and discounts can be up to 80 percent.</p>
                  <p>A wide range of medical treatments, providers, and facilities are included in Medibid, including overseas providers and facilities. Hospital and surgical services are also available through Medibid. Patients can submit medical treatment requests rngng from a simple annual exam to a full hip- or knee-replacement surgery.</p>
                  <p>Medibid charges about $25 for a single treatment request, or approximately $5 a month to subscribe to the site.</p>

                  <p>Discounts off of list prices for healthcare range from 20 to 80 percent. Unlike Medibid, providers in Health in Reach do not bid on specific patients; instead, the list their prices and provide an easy mechanism to book an appointment. Information on providers is included along with the price.</p>
                  <p>The priniple benefit provided by Health in Reach is price transparency: patients know exactly how much, in advance, their visit will cost them. Once a patient finds a provider offering the best value, they are able to use the Health in Reach website to book their appointments online. There are no fees to join or use the service.</p>

                  <p>MDSave(www.mdsave.com) works similar to Health in Reach, except that like Medibid it offers primary care providers and some specialists as well. Providers list their fees, for MDSave members alongside average prices. The site boasts that savings up to 60 percent are available by purchasing them through the site, although individual patients will have different levels of savings.</p>
