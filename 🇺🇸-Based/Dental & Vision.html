      <blockquote>
        <p>Fortunately, <strong>oral and vision care have only recently begun to be absorbed by bureaucratic medicine</strong>, meaning that <strong>many providers still are able to provide real and transparent prices for most routine services</strong>, including dental checkups, eye exams, teeth cleaning, and othe treatments. Countless stores offer eye exams, and big-box retailers like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/vision-centers/1078944" tabindex="02"><abbr title="Walmart Inc.">Walmart</abbr></a> and <a href="https://www.targetoptical.com/" tabindex="03"><abbr title="Target Brands, Inc. in partnership with Luxottica of America Inc." tabindex="04">Target</abbr></a> usually have eye clinics on their premises.</p>
        <p>This means that, unlike other chapters in this book, there is little need for additional for how to find a self-pay friendly provider of oral or dental care. <strong>Pretty much anybody you find in your community is going to be accustomed to dealing with patients who pay for their own care.</strong> It still pays to <strong>call and compare prices</strong>, though, and if you hear of a dentist or optometrist that doesn't accept insurance, that's probably your best bet.</p>
        <p><srong>For more expensive treatments and services</srong>, which can be thousands of dollars, <strong>dentists are often accustomed to working out payment plans</strong>. In addition, many of the discount cards for health services cover dental treatments.</p>

    <summary><strong>Thoughts on the Matter</strong></summary>
    <p>The competition of medical price-transparency, reverse-bidding options listed by the <cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite> blog-edition is quite intense. It touches another topics: See the "Medical-Discount Plans"-page & an upcoming "Price-Transparency Options"-page.
    <br>In terms of the Tally: To avoid double-counting, the already-counted DentalPlans.com & 1Dental® ("Medical-Discount Plans"-page) will not be counted (again) here.</p>
