        <dt>The book (published back in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>) mentions in its menu 4 healthcare-sharing ministries (H.S.M's), which are religious alternatives to health-insurance:</dt>
          <dd>📖 <strong>Samaritan Ministries International (S.M.I.)</strong>, also known as <a href="https://samaritanministries.org/"><strong>Samaritan™ Ministries</strong></a>, with their <a href="https://samaritanministries.org/resources/classic-basic-guidelines">Guidelines for Sharing in Classic/Basic</a></dd>
          <dd>📖 <strong>Christian Care Ministry, Inc.</strong>, or <a href="https://mychristiancare.org/"><strong>Christian Care Ministry (C.C.M.)</strong></a></dd>
          <dd>📖 <strong>Christian Healthcare Ministries, Inc.</strong>, or <a href="https://www.chministries.org/"><strong>Christian Healthcare Ministries (C.H.M.)</strong></a>, with its <a href="https://chministries.org/chm-guidelines/">CHM Guidelines</a></dd>
          <dd>📖 Gospel Light Mennonite Church Medical Aid Plan, Inc.'s <a href="https://www.libertyhealthshare.org/"><strong>Liberty HealthShare® (L.H.S)</strong></a>, with its <a href="https://www.libertyhealthshare.org/downloadable-resources">Sharing Guidelines</a></dd>
      </dl>
    </article>
    <article>
      <dl>
        <dt>With the <cite>S.P.P.</cite> blog-edition, more options came to light:</dt>
          <dd>💻 <a href="https://www.medishare.com/"><strong>Medi-Share</strong></a> (of C.C.M.), with their <a href="https://mychristiancare.org/medi-share/what-is-medishare/how-medi-share-works/medi-share-guidelines/">Medi-Share Guidelines</a></dd>
          <dd>💻 <strong>Altrua Ministries</strong> (d.b.a. “<a href="https://altruahealthshare.org/"><strong>Altrua HealthShare</strong></a>”, d.b.a. “<strong>Altrua SmileShare</strong>”), with their <a href="https://altruahealthshare.org/resources/guidelines/">Membership Guidelines</a></dd>
          <dd>💻 <a href="https://cmfcuro.com/"><strong>CURO</strong></a> (specifically-Catholic; of the <a href="https://christmedicus.org/">Christ Medicus Foundation</a>), which does "<a href="https://cmfcuro.com/sharing/">partner with Samaritan Ministries International (SMI)</a>" and, hence, uses Samaritan™ Guidelines for Sharing in Classic/Basic</dd>
          <dd>💻 <a href="https://www.solidarityhealthshare.org/"><strong>Solidarity HealthShare®</strong></a> (more Catholic-leaning; of the Melita Christian Fellowship Hospital Aid Plan) with the Solidarity HealthShare Foundation, Inc.; with their <a href="https://solidarityhealthshare.org/sharing-guidelines/">Sharing Guidelines</a></dd>
          <dd>💻 The eventual <cite>S.P.P.</cite>-sponsor <a href="http://thehealthcoop.com/"><s><strong>The Health Co-Op</strong></s></a>, has since exited the market for individual patients(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180808134126/http://thekarisgroup.com/services/karis-health-choice">re-directs to The Karis Group, Inc. since <time datetime="2018">2018</time></a>; interestingly serviced/helped-out its former-competitor, <a href="https://go.thekarisgroup.com/resources/case-study-samaritan-ministries">Samaritan™ Ministries</a>, and has been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121012194729/http://www.thehealthcoop.com/health-care-sharing/">Samaritan™-member since <time datetime="2012">2012</time></a>. Interestingly, the Karis Group site now re-directs to <a href="https://getadvocacy.com">GetAdvocacy</a></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Also, a new thing has happened: the creation of the <a href="https://ahcsm.org/">Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries (the Alliance)</a>, whose membership includes 3 of the ministries mentioned in the book (Christian Care Ministry, Samaritan™ Ministries, and Liberty HealthShare®). The Alliance also has 📝 <strong>OneShare Health, L.L.C.</strong> (<a href="https://www.onesharehealth.com/"><strong>OneShare Health®</strong></a>) as a member. (Note: Neither Mr. Pernell nor I have vetted it.)</p>
      <p>An option to consider may also be 📝 <strong>CrowdHealth, Inc.</strong> (<a href="https://www.joincrowdhealth.com/"><strong>CrowdHealth</strong></a>). (Again: Neither Mr. Pernell nor I have vetted it.) I only recently discovered its existence. OneShare Health® is also a new discover to me, but 3 of the vetted ministries have deemed them worthy of membership to the Alliance. No word yet from them about CrowdHealth.</p>

      <h1>Considerations for Selectng from H.S.M.'s</h1>
      <p><strong>Read the guidelines!</strong> If you assume they're identical to insurance (except on a religious framework), disappointments (& maybe even financial-disaster) reaching you may prove otherwise. Also, <strong>treatment of pre-existing conditions will vary</strong>.</p>
      <p>Considering the religious nature of (genuine, good-faith) H.C.S.M.'s (and given the ministries' target-audience are mostly practicing Christians), <strong>medical-expenses from violations of generally-accepted Christian morals</strong> (ex. from committing illegal activity, drug-abuse, intoxication, etc.)… <strong>are not likely to be considered</strong>. Abortions, sterilization, contraception, and the like are also unlikely to be considered. (For specifics on each ministry, <strong>read the guidelines</strong>.) <strong>Some require regular church-attendance</strong>, with a minister's affidavit to certify this. (Personally, I know L.H.S. does not. Also, check the others, for more options.) <strong>Requiring members to live by conservative values</strong> (ex. avoiding substance-abuse, promiscuity, etc.) also serves serves another purpose: lowering medical-expenses (ex. avoiding expenses from chronic drug-abuse on the body, sexually-transmitted diseases, etc.).</p>
      <p>As of <cite>S.P.P.</cite> book-edition's wwriting (back in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>), NONE of the 4 book-listed ministries ever failed to pay an eligible bill (back when H.S.M.'s were little-known and the memberships were mostly healthy and/or health-conscious). As can be seen from online-reviews after that year, the masive influx of the rest of the population when it became more popularized ended this. For certain, different H.C.S.M.'s have been coping, adjusting, and trying to recover from this. (More on that below.)</p>

      <h1>Caveat on H.C.S.M.'s, in General:</h1>
      <h2>ALSO: DO YOUR RESEARCH with H.S.M.'s! Some have gotten into legal-trouble, even getting banned from operating in certain States.
        <br>(Also, full disclosure: I've personally been a L.H.S.-member for a decade now.)</h2>
      <p>Now that the caveats have been mentioned, how do H.S.M.'s work?
        <ul>
          <li>Since they're legally NOT INSURANCE, insurance-terms are not be used with them. Hence, each ministry has its own terminology. For example, premiums are't collected by L.H.S.: "monthly contrubutions" are. The said ministry has no insurance-plan with any deductables, but an "Annual Unshared Amount (A.U.M.)" does exist with each level of membership offered.</li>
          <li>The system runs on altruism, mutual-charity, and religious obligaiton, as opposed to legal entitlements.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Has the last point been abused before? You bet! (Recently, <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202109281">bankruptcy was filed</a> by a so-called "Trinity HealthShare" that the Alliance has rightly called a "sham" <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/2022/04/health-care-sharing-ministries-bankrupt-sharity-trinity-unp/">after being found guilty of fraud</a>.) Be careful who gets awarded your hard-earned money!</p>

      <h1>Caveat on Liberty Healthshare, Specifically:</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Things have been rocky in L.H.S. with since 2020, and I'd like to compare notes with members of other H.S.M.'s, if possible. How are thing in your ministry?</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Taking the numbers reported in the members' e-mail newsletters and squeezing as much as I can from them on spreadsheets, I got this:</dt>
            <dd>● When I joined in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, contribtuions & shared bills were practically 1:1, and just under $60k per month. In just 1 year, that jumped to $1mil. We, the membership, were healthy & health-conscious people. BUT mainstream news-media started catching-on and raising awareness of H.S.M.'s existence. Wider society joined en masse! By <time datetime="2016">2016</time>, $5mil was normal for L.H.S.'s monthly revenue from <time datetime="2016-07">July</time> onward. It was <time datetime="2017">2017</time>, when the troubles began, with multi-million dollar monthly deficits appearing every do often. Not a problem, apparently, since monthly contributions of $20mil were starting, too. Big money! What could possibly go wrong? By <time datetime="2018">2018</time>, the monthly-rate was hiked by <time datetime="2018-06">June</time> (AFTER deficits of $10mil & approaching were added to monthly deficits), so contribution did jump to the 1x-maximum of $48mil by December. For <time datetime="2019">2019</time>, monthly revenue averaged $30mil, it seemed progress was made to address the backlog… And then, COVID attacked! From <time datetime="2020">2020</time>-<time datetime="2021">2021</time>, the contrubution-rate was raised again, top-leadership was replaced, and the membership-offerings were overhauled. The year <time datetime="2022">2022</time> was the year debt-elimination was on the forefront. By <time datetime="2024-09">September 2024</time>, 74% of the backlog was paid-off. As of <time datetime="2024-12">December 2024</time>, no furhter updates on paying-off the debt has been issued. (WHY‽) Also, monthly contributions have dropped to just below $12mil/month. (sigh)</dd>
            <dd>● So if you've read/heard of (current/former) L.H.S.-members complaining of unpaid expenses, this is why: the L.H.S. took-in too many high-expense new-members and failed to raise the monthly contrubution-rate accordingly. Also, a newsletter reported disingenuous "pump & dump"-members, who left directly after incurring and reporting heavy medical-bills. Then, there are reports like <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/liberty-healthshare-beers-family-insurance-ppp-ohio">this</a> & <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/liberty-healthshare-healthcare-sharing-ministries-obamacare">this</a>. How much of it is real, and how much of it is a smear-campaign from the insurance-industry, which would certainly benefit from the elimination of insurance-alternatives?</dd>
            <dd>● Personally, I'm healthy: I barely really need the routine, annual checkups. That said, my medical-bills have ALWAYS been paid from <time datetime="2014">2014</time> to today (early-<time datetime="2024">2024</time>), or I would have dropped my membership long ago! God willing, L.H.S.'s new leadership will continue the course of reforms & backlog-burning, so that the ministry will be debt-free by the end of <time datetime="2025">2025</time>! 🙏</dd>
            <dd>● If you're a member of another H.S.M. (whether listed here or not), wen did you join and how have things been with your ministry so far?</dd>
