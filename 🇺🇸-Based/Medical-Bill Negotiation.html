     <blockquote>
       In recent years, as <strong>the phenomenon of hospitals chargin outlandish pries to uninsured patients has come to the attenion of the media</strong>, more and <strong>more hospitals are recognizing the need to give a fair and reasonable price to patients who are payng for their own care</strong>.
       <br>While not as helpful as posting prices, <strong>many hospitals have begun to offer substantial discounts off their chargemaster prices</strong>. <a href="https://www.elcaminohealth.org/" tabindex="03">El Camino Hospital</a> in <a href="https://www.getcare.elcaminohealth.org/locations" tabindex="04">Silicon Valley</a>, says that they offer automatic 75 percent off of their bill for patients who pay in full at the time of serrvice (which should give you some idea of how madly they inflate their prices to begin with). <a href="https://www.bswhealth.com/" tabindex="05">Baylor Healh Systems</a>, with several hospitals in Texas, offers a 35 percent discount to uninsured patients. Both offer written estimates for the cost of many procedures, although the price is not binding and may be higher or lower in the end.
       <br>In some cases, <strong>your doctor may be able to help you negotiate a cash price</strong> for your treatment at a local hospital. You can also <strong>call the hospital billing department directly</strong>, and <strong>explain that you are a self-pay patient</strong> and <strong>ask how much</strong> a particular procedure will cost to have performed at their facility (remember, <strong>this probably won't include the surgeon's or treating doctor's fee</strong>).
       <br>Having a rough idea of what the hospital typically charges insurance companies for similar treatment can be extremely helpful in these circumstances. The <a href="https://www.healthcarebluebook.com/" tabindex="06"><cite>Health Care Blue Book¬Æ</cite></a> (of CareOperative, <abbr title="Limited Liability Company">L.L.C.</abbr>) <a href="https://www.healthcarebluebook.com/explore-bluebook-provider-directory/" tabindex="07"><cite>Provider Directory‚Ñ¢</cite></a>, described in the previous chapter, can be a good source for this information.

      <figure>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Ideally,</strong> the time to make your case for a discount is <strong>before you go in for a procedure</strong>. <strong>Call the medical facility</strong> and <strong>ask for the projected fees</strong>; <strong>if you have insurance, contact the company next to find out how much it will pay. Then talk over your situation with the billing department, requesting a break. You might win as much as 50 percent off full price if you offer to pay quickly by cash or check</strong>, says Cindy Holtzman, a medical billing advocate in Marietta, <abbr title="Georgia">Ga.</abbr>, who's part of a growing industry of professionals dedicated to aiding patients with billing disputes. Providers accustomed to accepting less than they'd like from insurers often realize that getting payment without hassle or delay is preferable to waiting for the full amount or having to hire a collection agency.</p>
          <p><strong>If you can't pay even a discounted amount promptly,</strong> you'll likely still be able to get a good deal if you <strong>promise regular payments of an agreed-upon size</strong>, Holtzman says. Patients with severe financial problems (especially those brought on by illness) may find their physician is compassionate enough to accept the insurer's portion as full payment. And uninsured low-income individuals who make too much to qualify for Medicaid may be eligible for free or reduced charity care.</p>
          <p><strong>The most effective way to get the billing department to trim its fees is to request, rather than demand, assistance.</strong> "People are always more likely to lend a hand when you <strong>acknowledge them as fellow human beings, rather than as bureaucrats</strong>," advises Michelle Katz, author of <cite>Healthcare for Less</cite>. Once you hammer out a payment plan, <strong>ask for your revised balance in writing</strong>.</p>
          <p>You'll also want to <strong>scrutinize all bills for errors</strong>. Katz's husband was once billed $11,000 for a three-hour <abbr title="emergency room">ER</abbr> visit because the hospital had recorded him as having checked in the day before. The corrected total was thousands of dollars less. Holtzman recalls one hospital charging nearly $1,000 for alcohol swabs and cups for medications. Those items, at least, come with the room.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>‚Ä¶When Suzanne came to me after receiving her $8, 000 bill for 30 minutes in the <abbr>ER</abbr> almost 1 year later, she could not recall some of the events that occurred in the <abbr>ER</abbr> or know why her insurance was not kicking in.  Who would?  On the other hand, what she could recall, was helpful enough to get that bill down to about $1, 500 and this is what we did:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Get an itemized copy of your bill from the hospital:</strong>  This is key to helping you recall events and navigate through that horrifying day.  Suzanne called the billing department and made that request via the phone and email‚Ä¶ She also told them to put her bill on hold while she was investigating the charges‚Ä¶ This ultimately ‚Äústops the clock‚Äù on any collections, and gets the hospital involved.  By doing this, you are letting them know, you are serious.</li>
            <li><strong>Get a copy of your medical chart:</strong>  This is legally yours and it will not only help you recall some of the finer details of the event, but it also might help uncover some of the mysterious charges on your bill.   When Suzanne and I compared this with the itemized bill we uncovered the following: wrong dates, wrong times, wrong amounts, double charges, unnecessary tests and even a wrong diagnosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Call up the insurance company to double check the information:</strong>  In this process, we discovered that one of the main reasons her insurance company did NOT kick in was somewhere in between filing the claim and capturing it, her birthdate was transcribed wrong‚Ä¶</li>
            <li><strong>Don‚Äôt wait for the billing department to call you:</strong>  As soon as you get all of the above information and highlight what seems like an obvious mistake to you and write down your questions, pick up that phone AND contact the billing department in writing and make that appointment to go over your bill‚Ä¶  Any delay on your part may throw your bill back onto the track to collections‚Ä¶</li>
            <li><strong>What you don‚Äôt understand, be sure to ask:</strong>  Remember that many of the people in the billing department do not have a medical background, so they might refer you to the doctor.  Ask them for help if you do not know the doctor‚Ä¶</li>
            <li><strong>Document:</strong> After the mistakes are found get a reprint of the bill.  Be sure your insurance company has a correct copy and if the balance is correct, pay for it immediately and be sure to get the zero balance in writing and keep this is your file for at LEAST a year‚Ä¶</li>
            <li><strong>Negotiate:</strong>  If you have a high deductible like Suzanne, there may be a balance even after insurance kicks in that is a tough amount to swallow.  Take the time to sit down with this billing person to talk about your situation and ask for a discount.  If that amount is too high, work out a payment plan that works for YOU and get your final agreement in writing.  You might be surprised what you can work out if you just ask.  Sometimes hospitals will accept a low cash amount to settle out your bill since setting up a payment plan can be time consuming and cost more for the hospital depending on the situation.</li>
            <li><strong>Say thank you:</strong>  I cannot emphasize this enough.  It is rare the billing department gets a thank you.  So one up your game!  A simple thank you may get you an ally in the billing department that may ‚Äúhave your back‚Äù if something goes amiss in the future.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In the end we were able to get Suzanne bill down to about $1, 500 and work out a payment plan that is comfortable to her that she can afford to keep up with her other bills without going into cardiac arrest at the end of every month‚Ä¶</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>You can get a pricing menu.</strong> Brand new applications like <cite>Health Care Blue Book</cite> allow you to type in a procedure, and provide a fair price based on your area, even breaking down each cost into categories including physician, facility, and anesthesia.</li>
            <li><strong>Take that fair price quote, and negotiate.</strong> Before the procedure, negotiate the price with the billing office or your doctor. The doctor may not be bound to the price quoted, and opening up the conversation could give the consumer a talking point, and leverage.</li>
            <li><strong>Find out what the government pays.</strong> You can find out what government programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, pay for the same procedures by doing some digging on the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/" tabindex="47"><abbr title="Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services">CMS</abbr> website</a>. Through the website, you can also find out what those procedure codes really mean. After you get your bill, you can use those codes to make sure there haven't been any billing errors.</li>

          <p><strong>Gretchen tweets: Any suggestions or resources to learn about negotiating medical bills?</strong></p>
          <p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/5-ways-avoid-medical-debt-180357548.html">Medical bills</a> can be intimidating, to say the least. With so many confusing line items and multiple bills arriving from a single hospital visit, it‚Äôs not always clear how costs get calculated. ‚Äú<strong>There‚Äôs so much outsourcing done by hospitals and often more than one entity associated with a single visit and the resulting bill</strong>,‚Äù says health care advocate and nurse Michelle Katz. According to Katz, bills can be difficult to decipher because a single visit or procedure can have various "professional" and "technical" <strong>components</strong>. <strong>Technical</strong> charges are those <strong>associated with facilities and equipment</strong>. <strong>Professional</strong> charges are for the <strong>services of the health care professionals involved with your visit</strong> -- some inside and others outside the hospital. For a basic X-ray, for example, your bill could include multiple charges from your doctor, the radiologist and for the actual X-ray.</p>
          <p>First, <strong>triple check your bills ‚Äì especially your hospital statements</strong>. <strong>Eight out of 10 hospital bills contain errors, increasing the bills by an average 25%</strong>, according to a survey by the <cite>Medical Billing Advocates of America</cite>. To avoid getting overcharged, <strong>track all your tests, medications</strong>, and <strong>check them against your medical file</strong> which you can get <strong>from your hospital‚Äôs billing office</strong>. <strong>If you spot an error, send them a letter in writing requesting to fix the mistake</strong> and <strong>keep your insurer notified by giving them a copy of all documentation</strong>. <strong>Check for erroneous dates</strong>, as well, says Katz, <strong>another red flag that some of the calculations are wrong</strong>. Watch out for <strong>double billing, too</strong>. ‚ÄúIf you see a charge for the same amount three or four times, often that‚Äôs the result of what I call ‚Äòfat fingers,‚Äô‚Äù she says.</p>
          <p><strong>And before a medical procedure, speak with your doctor about cost-saving alternatives or how you may be able to reduce your bill. Your physician has a fiduciary responsibility to help you meet your medical needs by not only prescribing you the right medicine, but also making sure your budgetary needs are met.</strong> ‚Äú<strong>Your doctor will be your best advocate</strong> in making sure you‚Äôre handled carefully by the billing department and may be given a deal,‚Äù says Katz. And best to <strong>come into that meeting after having done a little pricing homework</strong>. ‚ÄúYou can <strong>actually shop around in preparation</strong> for a hospital visit,‚Äù says Katz. You can find fair pricing estimates for common procedures and surgeries at <cite>HealthCareBlueBook.com</cite>. <strong>From there, ask your provider to beat or accept that rate.</strong></p>

    <summary><strong>Thoughts on the Matter</strong></summary>
    <p>Wow! And I thought the mental-health market was fierce. So many have exited (or "now seem to no longer relevant to") the medical-bill negotiation-market since <cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite>-blog went offline, back in early <time datetime="2021">2021</time>.</p>
    <p>Whether you oddities in a bill prompt you to choose a medical-bill negotiator or choose to negotiate yourself, do it! Not doing so can be quite costly.

        <p><strong>Of consumers who don‚Äôt reach out to question a medical bill, 86% said it‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt think it would make a difference</strong> ‚Äî but ‚Äúthe experiences of those who did reach out provide evidence to the contrary,‚Äù according to a new University of Southern California study.</p>
        <p><strong>About 26% of people who called because they disagreed with a charge or couldn‚Äôt afford to pay it got their medical bill corrected after the outreach</strong>, according to the study, published in August. <strong>Roughly 15% got a price reduction</strong>, <strong>8% got financial assistance</strong> and <strong>7% saw their bills canceled outright</strong>.</p>
        <p>‚Äú<strong>Of the people who did reach out, most of them got some recourse through self-advocacy</strong>,‚Äù said report co-author Erin Duffy, a research scientist at the <abbr title="University of Southern California">USC</abbr> Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.</p>
        <p>Researchers polled 1,135 U.S. adults from <time datetime="2023-08-15"><abbr title="August">Aug.</abbr> 14</time> to <time datetime="2023-10-14"><abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 14, 2023.</time></p>
        <p><strong>About 1 out of 5 respondents reported receiving a medical bill with which they disagreed or could not afford within the prior 12 months. About 62% of them contacted the billing office to address the concern.</strong></p>
