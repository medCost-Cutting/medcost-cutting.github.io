          <summary><strong>From an Interview with <abbr>Ms.</abbr> <a href="https://www.gerridetweiler.com/" tabindex="38">Gerri Detweiler</a></strong></summary>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Michelle Katz helped save her husband‚Äôs life by quickly administering CPR when he had a heart attack. Then she went on to help save $8,000 in the medical bills that he subsequently incurred.</p>
            <p>She was in the perfect position to help start his heart again because she is a nurse. And she could then help him with his bills because she has a wealth of experience as a health care advocate and administrator. In fact, she herself was once a patient with more than $150,000 in medical debt that she managed to negotiate down.</p>
            <p>I recently interviewed Michelle on my radio show, <cite>Talk Credit Radio</cite>, to get her expert advice on how to negotiate medical bills. Here is an edited excerpt from that interview. (You‚Äôll find links to the entire podcast at the end of this article.)</p>
            <p><strong>Gerri:</strong> Michelle, you have been following the healthcare industry for about 15 years now and you‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs going on with healthcare costs, which we just see continuing to rise. What are some of the top strategies you recommend for consumers who are facing large medical bills and just don‚Äôt know where to start because they‚Äôre overwhelmed?</p>
            <p><strong>Michelle:</strong> Overwhelm comes with disorganization. You‚Äôre going to have bills flying at you at different times. Before you even leave the hospital, get an itemized bill just so you know what bills are coming in ‚Äî whether they‚Äôre from the radiologist, the anesthesiologist, the labs, whatever. Get an itemized bill because you will almost always find mistakes in these bills.</p>
            <p><strong>Gerri:</strong> Is that typical for them to give you one of those itemized bills? I don‚Äôt remember getting one when I‚Äôve gone to the emergency room.</p>
            <p><strong>Michelle:</strong> Right before you discharge, the nurse will ask you if you understand your protocols, and everything you‚Äôve been through, and all the treatments from here on forward. At that point you say, ‚ÄúIs it possible that I could have a copy of my itemized bill?‚Äù Sometimes they‚Äôll say it‚Äôll take a few days. At that point you ask how many days will it take and when can I pick it up ‚Äî within a week, five days? And make sure this is all documented. Some hospitals are really organized. They‚Äôll actually make you a printout before you leave the hospital. But at other times, just make sure you‚Äôre persistent.</p>
            <p><strong>Gerri:</strong> You had over $150,000 in medical debt from an accident. How did you approach it? I can‚Äôt imagine the feeling of getting those large bills.</p>
            <p><strong>Michelle:</strong> The bills just kept on coming in. Once I thought I paid one bill, another bill came up ‚Äî which is why getting itemized bills is the first step everybody should take.</p>
            <p>I couldn‚Äôt afford it, so I was in tears. I finally found someone in the billing department and I explained my situation. I was a student. I didn‚Äôt have health insurance. I had no idea how I was going to put myself through school as well as pay these medical bills. And believe it or not, they were willing to work with me.</p>
            <p>The thing people need to understand is try to get your composure, don‚Äôt scream at the person on the other line because sometimes you‚Äôre going to get the wrong person. Really important ‚Äî get the right person. If that first billing person has no idea, ask for the supervisor. And usually, the supervisor has heard all the stories ‚Äî everything.</p>
            <p>Be honest, and also make sure you get a negotiated rate. You can negotiate this down, look for mistakes with this billing person as well as negotiate the rates.</p>
            <p><strong>Gerri:</strong> Michelle, what about while you‚Äôre in the hospital? What kinds of things can you or should you be doing to make sure that you‚Äôre actually getting the health care that they‚Äôre billing you for?</p>
            <p><strong>Michelle:</strong> The big thing I tell people ‚Äî I know it‚Äôs hard when you‚Äôre in a hospital, because I‚Äôve been through it ‚Äî is to get a notepad and keep a journal. It‚Äôs great to keep a journal of just basically how you‚Äôre feeling. Doctors do like to see this. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling this way today,‚Äù as well as who came in, what was done, notes on maybe how to change your bandages. Go over this with the nurse who comes in. The nurses usually almost always are able to explain things and it helps them do their job better.</p>
            <p><strong>Gerri:</strong> And then you can list what medication you received and what procedures were done. I read about your husband‚Äôs situation, where you found that he had been billed for a medication that, had he been given it, would have been an overdose for him.</p>
            <p><strong>Michelle:</strong> Exactly. We call that ‚Äúfat fingers,‚Äù where the medical file is sent down to the billing department and sometimes they accidentally push in an extra code or an extra number. And in our case, they said they gave him extra units. It would‚Äôve been an overdose. And it looked funny to billing when I brought it to their attention.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind, they‚Äôre doing so many other different bills and billing procedures for different people that this can be overlooked, so it‚Äôs important that all of us are our own health care advocate.</p>
            <p><strong>Gerri:</strong> Yes. Although it just amazes me in this day and age with the technology that these bills still have so many mistakes. Have you seen an improvement because you‚Äôve been watching this for 15 years? Do you find fewer bills have <a href="https://www.credit.com/blog/an-insiders-guide-to-fighting-medical-billing-mistakes-62319/" tabindex="40">mistakes</a>, or are we still dealing with a lot of them?</p>
            <p><strong>Michelle:</strong> In every bill that has been brought to me, I can find at least 20% mistakes. And the reason why I‚Äôm finding more mistakes now is that I‚Äôm getting people more aware of this process and people are starting to ask. Whereas in the past, we just assume insurance covered everything, don‚Äôt worry about it. It‚Äôs amazing what happens when insurance stops covering procedures, how people start looking at their bills.</p>
            <p><strong>Gerri:</strong> Absolutely. We have higher-deductible policies now. We may have a higher co-pays. You may end up seeing a provider who‚Äôs out of network so you may be responsible for some the bill. So I don‚Äôt think you can assume going in that just because you have good insurance you‚Äôre not going to end up paying a lot of money.</p>
            <p><strong>Michelle:</strong> Yes, and there‚Äôs a lot of things happening with the exchanges where the hospital that you thought was in your insurance may not be in the exchange. So be sure you read the policy and you write down what hospitals are in your policy because I‚Äôve seen this happen too many times. You go to a hospital, you think they‚Äôre covered in your policy, and they‚Äôre not, and then you‚Äôre left with this huge bill. And that goes for doctors, too.</p>
            <p><strong>Gerri:</strong> Any other specific tips for problems that you see happen all the time?</p>
            <p><strong>Michelle:</strong> The big thing is ask questions and negotiate if you are with appeals process with insurance companies. A lot of times they don‚Äôt expect you to push forward. And what I mean by this is when you get denied a claim, really always ask why. Submit that appeal form. Be very persistent. The first time is always a no. The second time, the insurance will look into it further. And worst-case scenario, if everything gets denied, you‚Äôre seeing problems, you can go to the Department of Insurance of your state as well the attorney general to help you out in dealing with the insurance companies and other issues you have with billing.</p>
            <p><strong>Gerri:</strong> Should patients be doing this in writing or on the phone, or can you do a combination of the two?</p>
            <p><strong>Michelle:</strong> I would definitely do a combination of the two and always have something in writing and always verify. If you send a fax ‚Äî every time I send a fax talking about bills or negotiating or I get a rate, I always call (too). I write the patient‚Äôs name, the time I called, the date and a summary of what was said every time I‚Äôm on that phone. Every time you send a fax and email, call them to make sure they actually got it.</p>
            <p><strong>Gerri:</strong> Medical bills are negotiable, but it is up to you, the patient, to become proactive and negotiate those medical bills if you want to save the most money.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>When Heather‚Äôs daughter developed a reaction to an immunization, she took her back to the doctor. She knew she should not have been charged for the second visit. After all, she spent fourteen years working in medical billing and understood that the follow-up incidental visit should have been covered given the circumstances. However, the claim wasn‚Äôt properly coded and she found herself in the shoes of many of the patients she helped over the years, trying to fix a medical billing mistake.</p>
            <p>Heather, who is leaving the field to pursue an accounting career, says that medical billing snafus are all-too-common. But don‚Äôt automatically blame the billing clerk, she says. Oftentimes, mistakes are made before the account even gets to the person responsible for submitting the claim to the insurance company.</p>
            <p>‚ÄúThe number one problem I (saw) was not that the patient had not provided proper billing information, but that front desk employees failed to update the system,‚Äù she explains. As part of her job, she would research records and call patients before she sent accounts to collections and often discovered a mistake that allowed her to properly bill the insurer.</p>
            <p>The problem may be getting worse, she worries, as medical practices consolidate into larger ones. She believes medical billing staff members with credible expertise are often underpaid and underappreciated, but at the same time she understands the frustration of the patients. ‚ÄúThey have jobs, lives and pay substantial premiums only to be made responsible for billing errors made by medical billers,‚Äù she wrote in a comment on a previous story about these issues.</p>
            <p>She shares these tips for avoiding a medical billing nightmare:</p>
            <p><strong>Verify Your File Contains Up-To-Date, Correct Insurance Information</strong></p>
            <p>The person at the front desk is often juggling multiple tasks and may not carefully check to make sure your information is correct. So while you are waiting to see the physician, you can double check yourself.</p>
            <p>‚ÄúAsk your provider for a printout of the ‚Äòpatient profile information screen‚Äô from their system, which should list all of your insurance information,‚Äù she recommends. Make sure it‚Äôs 100% accurate. One insurance company may have hundreds of addresses and departments listed for processing claims, she explains, and if the claim isn‚Äôt submitted to them correctly, it may be kicked back.</p>
            <p>Don‚Äôt assume that because you are still with the same insurance company that everything is the same. If you received a new insurance card since your last visit, you‚Äôll want to make sure your file is updated. The billing address or other key information may have changed, making it important that you update the information. Keep the corrected and dated ‚Äúpatient profile information screen‚Äù for your records until you have verified the bill for that date has cleared.</p>
            <p>Watch Your Mail</p>
            <p>After you have seen the provider, watch for an Explanation of Benefits statement from your insurance carrier that will list your financial responsibility. You should receive it within approximately 30 ‚Äî 45 days after your visit. If it doesn‚Äôt arrive, contact your provider immediately to find out why your insurance company has not been billed.</p>
            <p>When you do receive the EOB, you may find it confusing. If you do, call your insurance company and ask them to help you decipher it.</p>
            <p>If you believe there is a mistake, you‚Äôll want to contact the provider‚Äôs billing office. When you do call, don‚Äôt be surprised if the person you speak to within the billing office doesn‚Äôt fully understand what‚Äôs going on. ‚ÄúYou are not usually talking with the person who actually does the billing,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe person who you are talking with is likely a customer service representative and they may know very little about the process that has taken place or needs to take place.‚Äù</p>
            <p>If you don‚Äôt feel like your problem is being properly handled, Heather recommends you:
              <ol>
                <li>Call the provider‚Äôs office and ask for the exact amount of the services provided and a breakdown of the individual charges.</li>
                <li>Call the insurance company and ask them if they have a receipt of that claim.</li>
                <li>Then ask the insurance company if they will contact the provider on your behalf.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Don‚Äôt Let Them Balance Bill You</strong></p>
            <p>Medical providers who participate in insurance networks agree to a ‚Äúfee schedule,‚Äù this is often changed and updated each year as a part of the provider‚Äôs ‚Äúrecredentialing process.‚Äù Along with the contract the healthcare provider is given a fee schedule, Heather explains, that shows what the allowable amount for each procedure (CPT code) will be. By accepting this agreement, the provider in turn agrees not to bill to the insurance carrier‚Äôs customers more than the allowable amount.</p>
            <p>For example: A ‚Äúdoctor‚Äôs visit 99213‚Äù (CPT code) is a pretty standard office visit. The physician charges $110, the insurance carrier allows $58, and there may be a $30 copay. The insurance company will pay the provider $28, the patient pays $30 and the provider contractually must write-off, or as they call it, ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù the remaining $52 from the patient‚Äôs account.</p>
            <p>‚ÄúThis is more critical with expensive procedures like lab work, x-rays and the like,‚Äù she says, where charges may run in the hundreds or even thousands of dollars.In addition, providers who are contracted with specific insurance companies (often called ‚Äúparticipating providers‚Äù) must typically file a claim with the insurance company within 90 ‚Äî 120 days, depending on the insurance carrier‚Äôs contract. If they fail to do so, then they can‚Äôt hold the patient responsible for those charges. If a provider tries to ‚Äúbalance bill‚Äù you, either for an amount they are supposed to discount, or because they failed to bill in a timely manner, enlist your insurance company‚Äôs help.</p>
            <p>‚ÄúBottom line, healthcare providers sign contracts with insurance carriers to develop their patient pool, and patients unaware of the providers contractual obligation can unknowingly be held responsible,‚Äù she says.</p>
            <p>Plan Ahead</p>
            <p>Because hospital bills in particular can be very large and confusing, it‚Äôs a good idea to meet with the billing department in advance to go over your insurance information. At that time, ask for a list of expected procedures and a ballpark estimate of the anticipated costs. This is typically done for self-pay patients; insist upon the same for you. Then call your insurance company to also go over with them what‚Äôs covered and what is not. ‚ÄúYou are the insurance company‚Äôs customer,‚Äù she insists. They should have a fee schedule that shows what they will pay.</p>
            <p>If you ended up in the hospital unexpectedly and are stuck with a confusing or large bill, make an appointment to visit with the billing department afterward to go over the charges, get answers to your questions and to make payment arrangements if possible. Hospitals know some patients have no intention of paying, so making the extra effort to show you want to resolve your bill can pay off.</p>
            <p>If it sounds like a lot of work, it is. But it can be worth it if it helps you avoid a collection account on your credit reports for the next seven years.</p>
            <p>In Heather‚Äôs case, she ended up paying the additional copay rather than fight it. She knows that if she can‚Äôt fix a mistake, it must be that much harder for the average patient. ‚ÄúThere needs to be a place for patients to go where they have an advocate,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve paid your insurance and provided your information you shouldn‚Äôt be at their mercy.‚Äù</p>
