    <div>As per Mr. Sean Parnell's "<span class="title">Self-Pay Patient</span>"-blog:
      <blockquote cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308044505/http://selfpaypatient.com/selfpayhealthcaremarket/">
        <h1>Welcome to the Self-Pay Healthcare Market!</h1>
        <h2>The following is a partial list of providers, facilities, web sites, and other companies and organizations that cater to or at least are especially helpful to self-pay patients. The list is definitely incomplete, as I continue to discover new options for self-pay patients I will add to the list. If you have any recommendations to add to the list, please send me an e-mail at selfpaypatient@gmail.com!</h2>
      </blockquote>

    <p>Back in 2014, Mr. Parnell published the book, <span class="title"><a href=“https://www.amazon.com/dp/0991209400">The Self-Pay Patient: Affordable Healthcare Choices in the Age of Obamacare</a></span> (<span class="title">S.P.P.</span>). And since books get outdated on printing, he also setup and managed & the now-late, great (just-cited) <span class="title">S.P.P.</span> <a href=“https://selfpaypatient.com/”>blog</a>-edition, where people could share their own cost-cutting discoveries & how it worked for them. These would be added, and the listing ("The Self-Pay Healthcare Market") would become even MORE comprehensive!</p>
    <p>With medical-costs where they are now, would't it be great we had an updated list for now (2025 & beyond)?</p>
    <p>Well, this is my attempt.</p>
    <p>As can be imagined, there's a lot of back-tracking to do. Of course, that won't stop me from adding my own discoveries, too. (Options from the books will have "📖" on it, while "💻" will be on the blog-listed entries. My own will have "📝" on them.) Tallying everything together, the <span class="title">S.P.P.</span>'s menu included 296 options: 194 book-exclusive + 102 new, in-blog. How many are still available to us today? Let's see!</p>
    <p>Yeah, med_Cost-Cutting is still in its initial phases. (Sorry for the flaws!) It will improve (God willing it). Mr. Parnell’s groundbreaking project was U.S.-based. I eventually hope to extend this worldwide, since EVERYONE needs affordable healthcare. Let’s see how Lord <span class="god" lang=“he-IL”>יהוה</span> leads.</p>
    <p>Status: Re-establishing a new website.</p>

        <dd>✔️Setup subReddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/med_costcutting/">r/med_costcutting</a>), which was banned… again (sigh). Anyone know how to stop this from repeating?</dd>
        <dd>✔️Setup e-mail address: <a href="mailto:med_cost-cutting@use.startmail.com">med_cost-cutting@use.startmail.com</a>.</dd>
