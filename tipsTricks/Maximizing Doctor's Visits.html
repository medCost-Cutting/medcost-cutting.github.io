          <p class="center"><strong>Have you ever been frustrated by an unproductive or inopportune visit with your doctor that wasted your time and money?
            <br>You can prevent that from happening again!</strong></p>
         <article>
          <p><strong>The Problem</strong>
           <br>Many visits with healthcare providers are poorly timed and less productive than they could be. Why? Because <strong>nobody is looking out for you between visits</strong>.
           <br>It‚Äôs not that your doctor doesn‚Äôt care.  He or she is simply too busy with clinical tasks to be able to optimize your visits.</p>
          <p><strong>As a result, you spend more money and get suboptimal care:</strong>
           <ul>
            <li>Extra visits and additional costs at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Incorrect or unnecessary testing and treatment.</li>
            <li>Rushed decisions and explanations.</li>
            <li>Some visits are so handicapped by poor planning that they accomplish nothing, wasting both your time and money.</li>
           </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="center"><strong>It is easy to minimize the number of visits and maximize the time with your doctor.
           <br>Read on to find out how.</strong></p>
         </article>
         <article>
          <p><strong>The Solution</strong>
           <br>You can easily accomplish more for less cost at the doctor‚Äôs office with what I call <strong>SMART Preparation</strong>. Each letter relates to an aspect of your visit that you might improve upon with a little thought and preparation: <strong>S</strong>cheduling, <strong>M</strong>edications, <strong>A</strong>genda, <strong>R</strong>ecords and <strong>T</strong>ests.
           <br><strong>The exercise will only take a minute or two and will pay off every time.</strong>

           <p class="center"><strong>Scheduling</strong>
            <br>Optimize visit timing and duration.
           </p>
           <p>
            <ul>
             <li><strong>Most important:</strong> When making the appointment, inform the receptionist of <strong>EVERY issue that you need to cover</strong> so that adequate time is scheduled.  If you think of additional topics to be addressed, call back to allow a previously scheduled visit to be extended.</li>
             <li><strong>Schedule visits just before medications refills are due</strong> to avoid wasting purchased prescriptions.</li>
             <li><strong>Using a mail-order pharmacy?</strong> Allow time for shipping to avoid expensive local refills.</li>
             <li><strong>Space out visits</strong> to different healthcare providers to avoid redundant care.</li>
            </ul>

           </p>
           <p>
            <ul>
             <li><strong>Most important:</strong> Bring your insurance <strong>drug formulary</strong> and/or <strong>pharmacy discount drug list</strong>.</li>
             <li>Be sure to know details about any <strong>ineffective or poorly tolerated past medications</strong>. (Tip: If you can‚Äôt remember a name or dose, check with the pharmacy.)</li>
             <li>Carry an accurate list of <strong>current medications</strong> and dosages.</li>

           <p>
            <ul>
             <li><strong>Most important:</strong> Make a prioritized <strong>list</strong> of items that you hope to address. ALWAYS present your list to the doctor at the start of the visit.</li>
             <li>Don‚Äôt count on your doctor to <strong>identify non-immediate issues</strong> that may soon need follow-up. (Tip: Look for any prescriptions that have fewer than five refills left.)</li>
             <li>Identify any <strong>future exam or paperwork deadlines</strong> (school, camp, daycare, work, employment, insurance). Address them now, or account for them in the timing of your visit.</li>

           <p>
            <ul>
             <li><strong>Most important:</strong> Turn in your <strong>homework</strong>. Examples might include home blood pressure measurements, blood sugar results or a detailed timeline of your symptoms.</li>
             <li>Gather or request <strong>all past records</strong> related to issues that you plan to address.</li>

            <ul>
             <li><strong>Most important:</strong> Consider what <strong>tests you will soon be due for</strong>. Get them out of the way now.</li>
             <li>Bring a copy of all recent and past pertinent <strong>test results done elsewhere</strong>.</li>
             <li><strong>Get a copy</strong> of any test results performed this visit.</li>

     <summary><strong>Thoughts on the Matter</strong></summary>
     <p>Granted, some of the informaion-gathering mentioned is now more easily done now, than back in <time datetime="2010">2010</time> (especaially given of the "<a href="https://www.mychart.org/" tabindex="06">MyChart</a>¬Æ"-app of Epic Systems <abbr title="Corporation">Corp.</abbr>), but the principle of preparing before the appointment is STILL crucial in making the most of doctor's appointmens. Personally, I'm still quite impressed by the article, hence my posting it here. What do YOU think? Any other ideas, comments, or suggestions to further maximize your visits?</p>
