      <summary><strong>How It All Started‚Ä¶</strong></summary>
      <p>As per Mr. Sean Parnell's <cite>Self-Pay Patient</cite> (<cite><abbr title="Self-Pay Patient">S.P.P.</abbr></cite>) blog-edition:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308044505/http://selfpaypatient.com/selfpayhealthcaremarket/">
        <h1>Welcome to the Self-Pay Healthcare Market!</h1>
        <h2>The following is a partial list of providers, facilities, web sites, and other companies and organizations that cater to or at least are especially helpful to self-pay patients. The list is definitely incomplete, as I continue to discover new options for self-pay patients I will add to the list. If you have any recommendations to add to the list, please send me an e-mail at selfpaypatient@gmail.com!</h2>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Back in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, Mr. Parnell published the book, <cite>The Self-Pay Patient: Affordable Healthcare Choices in the Age of Obamacare</cite> ("<cite><abbr title="The Self-Pay Patient: Affordable Healthcare Choices in the Age of Obamacare">S.P.P.</abbr></cite>"; in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0991209400" tabindex="01">paperback</a> & <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HBUPLFG" tabindex="02">e-book</a> versions). And since books get outdated on printing, he also setup and managed & the now-late, great (just-cited) <cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite> <a href=‚Äúhttps://selfpaypatient.com/‚Äù tabindex="03">blog</a>-edition, where people could share their own cost-cutting discoveries & how it worked for them. These would be added, and the listing ("The Self-Pay Healthcare Market") would become even MORE comprehensive!</p>
      <p>This ever-improving menu continued developing and expanding‚Ä¶ until <time datetime="2021">2021</time>-<time datetime="2022">2022</time>. Then, it (unfortunately) vanished.</p>
      <p>With medical-costs where they are now, would't it be great we had an updated list for now (<time datetime="2025">2025</time> & beyond)?</p>
      <p>Well, this is my attempt.</p>

      <summary><strong><cite>Project: "med_Cost-Cutting"</cite> Introduction</strong></summary>
      <p>As can be imagined, there's A LOT of back-tracking to do: an impressive (& daunting) 296 options, if my count is correct. Of course, that won't stop me from adding my own discoveries, too.
        <ul>
          <li>On Icons & Information-Sources
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>198 (<span class="underline">options from the <cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite> book-edition will have "üìñ"</span></strong> on it.</li>
              <li>The <strong>111 <span class="underline">options listed in the <cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite> blod-edition will have "üíª"</span></strong> on them.</li>
              <li><strong><span class="underline">My own 11 will have "üìù"</span></strong> on them.</li>
              <li>Options gathered from other (non-<cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite>) sources will have "üó£" on them.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On Icons of Government-Options
            <ul>
              <li>Regardless of source (Mr. Parnell, me, or another).<span class="underline"><abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Federal and/or State government-provided options have "üá∫üá∏"</span> on them.</li>
              <li><span class="underline">My added Philippine government-provided options will have "üáµüá≠"</span>, instead.</li>
              <li><span class="underline">Whatever other relevant government's flag</span> will be on options for whatever other jurisdiction will be included in this project in the future.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        How many of these (over 300!) options are still available to us today? Let's see!

      <summary><strong>The Project's New Direction</strong></summary>
      <p>As can be noticed, I've discovered new sources and have begun to include them in <cite>medCost-Cutting</cite>. Also, I've integrated another, much-older project into this: "<a href="https://the2-x.github.io/"><cite>The 2-X Series</cite></a>"-Project, which has an even broader scope for even MORE info-sharing, mutual-learning. Dividing time & effort for development may be a challenge, but he show MUST go-on!</p>
